## The ipynb files of the project contain the following things in them:
### CE6670 Project Part - 1 : 
- Data cleaning, slicing, processing and extraction of Annual Extreme streamflow values
- Stationarity test to identify stations that have stationary timeseries for further analysis
- Fitting 3 candidate probablity distributions to all the Stations that are stationary
- Conducting K-S Goodness-of-fit test to obtain the best fitting probability distribution
- Calculating and saving the quantile values from the chosen distribution for further analysis
### CE6670 Project Part - 2 : 
- Cleaning and collecting other predictor variables like, soil, geometry, topography, catchment and other characteristcs
### CE6670 Project Part - 3 : 
- Conducting exact same procedure as done for Part - 1 for the annual streamflow extremes
- Fitting probablity distribution to annual max precipitation values and quantile calculation
### CE6670 Project Part - 4 : 
- Creating the X: Independent and Y variables from the Parts 1, 2 and 3
- Standardising the data using standard scaling
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Training and test of the Regression models: Linear Regression, ANN, XgB and SVR
- Analysis of the results
### CE6670 Project Part - 5 : 
- Correlation between the streamflow and precipitation values
- Miscellaneous analysis and plot
